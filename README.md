# deck-slides.el

Emacs integration of [k1LoW/deck] command.

## Install

Evaluating the following Lisp code will install the latest package:

```elisp
(package-vc-install
'(deck-slides :url "https://github.com/zonuexe/deck-slides.el.git"
              :main-file "deck-slides.el"))
```

As a developer, I have only checked it on Emacs 30.2, but it may work on earlier versions, so if you are interested, please send Pull Requests.

## Usage

### Edit Credentials File

To use the `deck` command, you need to set up your own developer project from the Google Cloud console and save it as `credentials.json`. You can visit this file from Emacs using `M-x deck-slides-find-credentials-json`.

### Apply Markdown to Google Slides

Open the Markdown file you want to apply as slides and run `M-x deck-slides-apply` or `M-x deck-slides-apply-watch`. When running for the first time, it's recommended to verify that `deck apply` works correctly in the terminal first.

> [!TIP]
> Slide pages must be separated by `---` on independent lines. Other symbols or characters of different lengths are not recognized as page separators.

The watch command process runs in the `*compilation*` buffer. To stop watching, kill the `*compilation*` buffer.

### Check Slide Layout Names

Run `M-x deck-slides-ls-layouts` to list the layout names of slides corresponding to the file you're editing.

> [!TIP]
> The results of this command are cached as buffer-local variables. The cache is discarded when you run `C-u M-x deck-slides-ls-layouts` or kill the buffer.

### Page Configuration Commands

## ðŸ’¡Tips

### Auto-activate deck-slides-mode

You can automatically activate `deck-slides-mode` when opening Markdown files that have a presentation ID in their frontmatter.

Add this advice to your Emacs configuration:

```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'markdown-mode
  (advice-add 'markdown-mode :after #'deck-slides-auto-activate-mode))
```

This will automatically activate `deck-slides-mode` for any Markdown file that starts with:

```yaml
---
presentationID:
```

### Auto-open browser before watch mode

You can automatically open the Google Slides presentation in your browser when starting watch mode.

Add this advice to your Emacs configuration:

```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'deck-slides
  (advice-add 'deck-slides-apply-watch :before #'deck-slides-open-browser-current-buffer))
```

This will automatically open the presentation in your browser whenever you start `deck-slides-apply-watch`, making it easier to see the changes in real-time.
